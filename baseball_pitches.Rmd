## Extracting PITCHf/x Data
### Introduction


PITCHf/x, created and maintained by Sportvision, is a system that tracks the speeds and trajectories of pitched baseballs. This system, which made its debut in the 2006 MLB playoffs, is installed in every MLB stadium [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PITCHf/x).

We will make pitch location charts, visulaize lots of charts which will include: 

* where pitches were thrown? 
* what kind of pitches they were? 
* how fast they were? 
* who the batter was? 
* what the inning was? 
* the order in which pitches were thrown and 
* whether the batter was left handed or right handed?


We will pick a game: Pittsburgh Pirates Vs Washington Nationals - June 20th, 2015. There's a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iQr5-rD8PY), watch it after visualization.

Luckily, the dataset is available. Here's the [link](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/). If we go deeper we will get xml file. R provides us a very nice package that will scrape the data for us and setup dataframe to use.

So, let's get started with coding.

### Scraping the Data
The package is  "pitchRx". Install the package and load it. Then to scrape the data, the function we need is scrape() and put the game id.<br>
Then get the datasets available to use from the bdata. 'atbat' and 'pitch' are the one we are interested in.


```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('pitchRx')
```
```{r message=FALSE}
library(pitchRx)

#store in a variable
bdata <- scrape(game.ids = "gid_2015_06_20_pitmlb_wasmlb_1")

#get the datasets
names(bdata)
```

Explore the dataset:

```{r}
#Atbat Datset
head(bdata$atbat)

#pitch Dataset
head(bdata$pitch)
```

Why to use bdata$ again and again. Let's put both into new variables.
```{r}
atbat <- bdata$atbat
pitch <- bdata$pitch
```

### Joining atbat and pitch Dataframes

Why we are joining the two datasets? Because I want to know like, if I have a particular pitch, then who the batter was? and this information we will get from atbat dataframe.

Looking the datasets above. We can see a column 'num' that is common to both.
'num' gives unique number to each atbat in the game.

So, now we will first join the two dataframes by 'num'. To do this we'll bring dplyr package.
```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

#store into new variable
nh <- inner_join(atbat, pitch, by="num")
```

If you want to know what the columns means : <br>

### Choosing Columns we are interested in

To get the column names we use:
```{r}
names(atbat)
names(pitch)
```
Now we will see which one to pick from atbat dataframe.

We are only interested in 'top' inning_side.
So we will filter out that first and then select the columns.

```{r}
nh <- inner_join(atbat, pitch, by="num")%>%
  filter(inning_side.x=='top')%>%
  select(num,start_tfs,stand,event,inning.x,batter_name,des,tfs,start_speed,px,pz,pitch_type)

#Take a look
head(nh)
```



##Visualizations

Now that we have build our dataframe. It's time to do some visualization.

### The Strike Zone

First we'll built the strike zone. Strike Zone varies from batter to batter as it depends on batter's height. So we will take average of strike zone area.<br>
We will have 1.9*1.9 area of strike zone, and we will look it as catcher's view who stands behind the batter. <br>
As shown in image.

![Strike Zone](https://github.com/myselfHimanshu/Baseball-Pitches/blob/master/plots/strike_zone.jpg)


### Drawing the strike zone

First, we will make x coordinate vector and z coordinate vector and will combine them both to make dataframe.

```{r}
x <- c(-.95,.95,.95,-.95,-.95)
z <- c(1.6,1.6,3.5,3.5,1.6)

#store in dataframe
sz <- data_frame(x,z) 
```

Now, we will use ggplot to make the strike zone.
px and pz will be useful for pitches location(coordinate) and we will start_speed for the size of the pitch.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = nh,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.01,3))
```

Now, we will differentiate pitches by pitch_type whether pitch was fastball or slider or changeup etc.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = nh,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_type))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.01,3))
```

Ok, this looks cool. But we got abbrevations of pitch_type instead of full description.<br>
So, we will change that to full description.

First we need to search the pitch_type and change it to its full name.

```{r}
#store pitch_type in new variable
pitch_desc <- nh$pitch_type

#search abbr. and change to full name
pitch_desc[which(pitch_desc=='FF')] <- "four-seam fastball"
pitch_desc[which(pitch_desc=='SL')] <- "slider"
pitch_desc[which(pitch_desc=='FC')] <- "fastball cutter"
pitch_desc[which(pitch_desc=='CU')] <- "curveball"
pitch_desc[which(pitch_desc=='CH')] <- "changeup"

#Add new column to the dataframe
nh$pitch_desc <- pitch_desc
```

Now, change pitch_type to pitch_desc

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = nh,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.01,3))
```

Now, that looks more informative.

## Working with Colors

### Changing Hue

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = nh,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.005,2.5))+
  scale_color_hue(h=c(180,0), c=100, l=50)
```

### Manual Coloring

```{r}
#pitch type visualization
#Manual Color Specification

ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = nh,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.005,2.5))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c('green','blue','pink','red','black'))
```

### Faceting

Now we are interested in right hand and left hand batter. We want 'L' for left handed and 'R'for right handed on the plot.

We will use stand to do that. We will put Left handed on 1.5 x-axis and R on -1.5, keep in mind we are the catcher.

```{r}
#Store stand in new variable
stand_xcoord <- nh$stand

#Initialize
stand_xcoord[which(stand_xcoord=='L')] <- 1.5
stand_xcoord[which(stand_xcoord=='R')] <- -1.5

#change to numeric
stand_xcoord <- as.numeric(stand_xcoord)

#Create new column in dataframe
nh$stand_xcoord <- stand_xcoord
```

Now we will plot text using geom_text.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = nh,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.005,2.5))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red','blue','green','yellow','black'))+
  facet_wrap(~stand)+
  geom_text(data = nh,aes(label=stand, x = stand_xcoord),y=2.5,size=6)
```

Now, we are interested in plotting batter name and inning on the plot.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = nh,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.005,2.5))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c('green','blue','yellow','red','black'))+
  facet_wrap(~num)+
  geom_text(data = nh,aes(label=stand, x = stand_xcoord),y=2.5,size=4)+
  geom_text(data = nh,aes(label=batter_name),x=0,y=0.5,size=2.5)+
  geom_text(data = nh,aes(label=inning.x),x=0,y=4.5,size=2.2)
```

## At-Bat

Now, we will plot pitches of specific batter and specific inning.

```{r}
#Specific Batter and inning

batter <- "Pedro Alvarez"
inning <- 5

#create atbat dataframe
ab <- nh%>%filter(batter_name==batter, inning.x==inning)
```

Plot the inning and batter name as the title of the plot

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = ab,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.005,2.5))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c('black','blue','red','yellow','green'))+
  geom_text(data = ab,aes(label=stand, x = stand_xcoord),y=2.5,size=5)+
  xlim(-2,2)+
  ylim(0,4.5)+
  ggtitle(paste("Inning",inning," | ",batter))
```

Next, we want label to the pitches, as what happened to that pitch? We will get that information from 'des' column.

```{r}
#labelling pitches

des <- nh$des
event <- nh$event

#This is use because instead of "In play" as des we need what exactly happened.
des[which(des=='In play, out(s)')] <- event[which(des=='In play, out(s)')]
nh$des2 <- des

ab <- nh%>%filter(batter_name==batter, inning.x==inning)
```

Now plot the data.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = ab,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.005,2.5))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c('black','blue','red','yellow','green'))+
  geom_text(data = ab,aes(label=stand, x = stand_xcoord),y=2.5,size=5)+
  xlim(-2,2)+
  ylim(0,4.5)+
  ggtitle(paste("Inning",inning," | ",batter))+
  geom_text(data = ab, aes(label=des2, x=px, y=pz),size=2.5, vjust=2)
```

Now, that's what we wanted. great!!!

Next, we want numbering to the pitches, which one was first? which second?..and so on.
We will use 'tfs' column for the numbering.

```{r}
#Counting number of pitches in an atbat

nh <- nh%>%
  arrange(tfs)

temp <- nh%>%
  group_by(num)%>%
  summarise(num_of_pitches <- n())

pitch_enum <- unlist(lapply(temp$`num_of_pitches <- n()`,seq))
nh$pitch_enum <- pitch_enum
```

Now plot the data. Visulaize Pitch Enumeration

```{r}
#visualize pitch enum

#Specific Batter and inning

batter <- "Jose Tabata"
inning <- 9

#create atbat dataframe
ab <- nh%>%filter(batter_name==batter, inning.x==inning)


ggplot()+
  geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
  coord_equal()+
  xlab("feet from home plate")+
  ylab("feet above the ground")+
  geom_point(data = ab,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.005,2.5))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c('violet','red','black','yellow','green'))+
  geom_text(data = ab,aes(label=stand, x = stand_xcoord),y=2.5,size=5)+
  xlim(-2,2)+
  ylim(0,4.5)+
  ggtitle(paste("Inning",inning," | ",batter))+
  geom_text(data = ab, aes(label=des2, x=px, y=pz),size=2.5, vjust=2)+
  geom_text(data = ab, aes(label=pitch_enum, x=px, y=pz),size=2.5, vjust=-1.2)
```

## Slide Show

Now we want to plot like above for every batter and will save the image.

First we will specify the colors for pitch description, so that colors are same for particular description in every plot.

```{r}

colors <- c("red","blue","orange","green","purple")
names(colors) <- c('four-seam fastball','slider','fastball cutter','curveball','changeup')

```

Next, using for loop we will save plot of every batter using gsave().

```{r message=FALSE}
#Specific Batter and inning
for(i in unique(nh$num)){

    
    #create atbat dataframe
    ab <- nh%>%filter(num==i)
    
    batter <- ab$batter_name[1]
    inning <- ab$inning.x[1]
    
    pitches <- unique(ab$pitch_desc)
    
    #Speed Size should be same in every plot
    zmax <-(max(ab$start_speed)-75.4)/22
    zmin <-(min(ab$start_speed)-75.4)/22
    
    plot <- ggplot()+
      geom_path(data = sz, aes(x=x, y=z))+
      coord_equal()+
      xlab("feet from home plate")+
      ylab("feet above the ground")+
      geom_point(data = ab,aes(x=px,y=pz,size=start_speed, color=pitch_desc))+
      scale_size(range = c(2.495*zmin+0.005,2.495*zmax+0.005))+
      scale_color_manual(values = colors[pitches])+
      geom_text(data = ab,aes(label=stand, x = stand_xcoord),y=2.5,size=5)+
      xlim(-2,2)+
      ylim(0,5)+
      ggtitle(paste("Inning",inning," | ",batter))+
      geom_text(data = ab, aes(label=des2, x=px, y=pz),size=2.5, vjust=2)+
      geom_text(data = ab, aes(label=pitch_enum, x=px, y=pz),size=2.5, vjust=-1.2)
    
    ggsave(paste("atbat",i,".png",sep = ""), plot)
}
```

## Wrap Up.

Now we will look at some some of the plots we saved as image.
